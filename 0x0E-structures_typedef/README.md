# Project 0x0E - C: Structures, typedef

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- Understanding structures: when, why, and how to use them
- Working with `typedef` in C programming

## Project Overview
This project delves into the world of structures and `typedef` in C. The tasks included aim to reinforce your understanding of structures and how to use `typedef` to create more readable and efficient code.

## Requirements
### General
- **Allowed editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- Do not use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `printf`, `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`.
- All your header files should be include guarded

## Project Structure
- Each task should be implemented in a separate C file.
- Don't forget to push your header file.

## Tasks
- **Task 0:** ...
- **Task 1:** ...
- ...
