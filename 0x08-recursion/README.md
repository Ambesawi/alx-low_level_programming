# 0x08. C - Recursion

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

### General

- **Recursion:**
  - Understanding what recursion is.
  - Knowing how to implement recursion.

- **Implementation of Recursion:**
  - How to implement recursion in C.

- **Situations for Recursion:**
  - Knowing in what situations you should implement recursion.

- **Situations to Avoid Recursion:**
  - Understanding in what situations you shouldn't implement recursion.

### Copyright - Plagiarism

You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives. You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work. You are not allowed to publish any content of this project. Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

### Requirements

#### General

- **Allowed Editors:**
  - vi, vim, emacs.

- **Compilation Environment:**
  - All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.

- **File Ending:**
  - All your files should end with a new line.

- **README.md at Root:**
  - A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository.

- **README.md in Project Folder:**
  - A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory.

- **Betty Style:**
  - Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.

- **No Global Variables:**
  - You are not allowed to use global variables.

- **No Loops:**
  - You are not allowed to use any kind of loops.

- **No Standard Library:**
  - You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc., is forbidden.

- **_putchar:**
  - You are allowed to use `_putchar`.

- **Prototype File:**
  - The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`.

- **Function Limit:**
  - No more than 5 functions per file.

### More Info

You do not have to push `_putchar.c`; we will use our file. If you do, it won’t be taken into account. In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do, we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the ones shown in the examples.
