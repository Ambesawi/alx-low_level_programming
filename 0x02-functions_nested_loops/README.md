# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

### General

- **Nested Loops:**
  - Understanding what nested loops are and how to use them.

- **Functions:**
  - Knowing what a function is and how to use functions.

- **Declaration vs Definition:**
  - Understanding the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function.

- **Prototypes:**
  - Knowing what a prototype is.

- **Scope of Variables:**
  - Understanding the scope of variables.

- **gcc Flags:**
  - Knowing what the `gcc` flags `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89` are.

- **Header Files:**
  - Knowing what header files are and how to use them with `#include`.

### Requirements

#### General

- **Allowed Editors:**
  - vi, vim, emacs.

- **Compilation Environment:**
  - All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.

- **File Ending:**
  - All your files should end with a new line.

- **README.md at Root:**
  - A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.

- **Betty Style:**
  - Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.

- **No Global Variables:**
  - You are not allowed to use global variables.

- **Functions Limit:**
  - No more than 5 functions per file.

- **Standard Library:**
  - You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden.

- **Allowed Function:**
  - You are allowed to use `_putchar`.

- **_putchar.c:**
  - You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do, it won’t be taken into account.

- **Main.c Files:**
  - In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo. We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples.

- **Header File:**
  - The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`.

- **Pushing Header File:**
  - Don’t forget to push your header file.
