### More Info

You do not have to understand the call by reference (address), stack, static variables, recursions, or arrays, yet. You can customize this template further based on your project's specific details, replacing placeholders like `0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops` with your actual project title and adding any additional information relevant to your project.
