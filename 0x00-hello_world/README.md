## More Info

### Betty Linter

To run the Betty linter just with the command `betty <filename>`:

1. Go to the [Betty repository](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty)
2. Clone the repo to your local machine
3. `cd` into the Betty directory
4. Install the linter with `sudo ./install.sh`
5. `emacs` or `vi` a new file called `betty`, and copy the script provided in the project description.
6. Save the file, exit, and change permissions with `chmod a+x betty`
7. Move the `betty` file into the `/bin/` directory or somewhere else in your `$PATH` with `sudo mv betty /bin/`
8. You can now type `betty <filename>` to run the Betty linter!
