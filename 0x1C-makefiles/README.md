# C - Makefiles

## Description

This project explores the use of Makefiles in C programming. Makefiles are essential for automating the build process of a project. This project covers the basics of make, Makefiles, rules, variables, and their applications in C programming.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the concepts of make and Makefiles.
- Understand when, why, and how to use Makefiles in C projects.
- Define rules in a Makefile and use them effectively.
- Differentiate between explicit and implicit rules.
- Identify common and useful rules in Makefiles.
- Set and use variables in Makefiles.

## Project Requirements

- Use allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Version of gcc: 9.3.0.
- Version of make: GNU Make 4.2.1.
- End all files with a new line.
- Include a mandatory `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
