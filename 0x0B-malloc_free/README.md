- **No Global Variables:**
  - You are not allowed to use global variables.

- **Function Limit:**
  - No more than 5 functions per file.

- **Standard Library Limitation:**
  - The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc` and `free`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc., is forbidden.

- **Prototype File:**
  - The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`.

- **Memory Leak Prevention:**
  - You do not have to learn about `calloc` and `realloc`.
