# Project 0x0F - C: Function Pointers

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- Understanding function pointers and their usage
- The exact content of a function pointer
- The virtual memory location where a function pointer points

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the concept of function pointers in the C programming language. You will explore what function pointers are, how to use them, and understand the details of what a function pointer exactly holds. Additionally, you'll learn about the virtual memory location where a function pointer points.

## Requirements
### General
- **Allowed editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- Do not use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`
- You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do, it won’t be taken into account
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `function_pointers.h`
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded

## Project Structure
- Each task should be implemented in a separate C file.
- Don't forget to push your header file.

## Tasks
- **Task 0:** ...
- **Task 1:** ...
- ...

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create your C files and implement the required functionality for each task.
4. Compile your code using the provided compilation command.
5. Execute your program to test its functionality.
